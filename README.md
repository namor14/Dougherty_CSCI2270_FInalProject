# Dougherty_CSCI2270_FinalProject
My Project consists of a graph of Airports. Each of these airports has a linked list contained within that contains each Airline’s flight map. Each connection between airports will be weighted by the number of miles between the airports. The airline’s flight map will also be a graph which will necessarily be a subset of the primary graph. A user may select two destinations and receive fastest route, the fastest route an individual airline may offer, display the contents of the Airport map, the map of a specific airline. Each Airport will be a struct containing a linked list of airlines present and name of city, where each airline will be a struct containing their flight map. Data will be fed into the program using a text file wherein each city exists and has its available airlines contained within, which will be processed and read in to the vertices of the airport graph, and from there the airline maps will be subsequently constructed.
