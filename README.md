# Dougherty_CSCI2270_FinalProject
My Project consists of a graph of Airport classes. Each #of these airports has a linked list contained within that contains each Airline’s flight #map. Each connection between airports will be weighted by the number of miles between the #airports. The airline’s flight map will also be a graph which will necessarily be a #subset of the primary graph. A user may select two destinations and receive fastest route #each airline may offer, display the contents of the Airport map (cities and airlines) or #the map of a specific airline, choose a function to output which airline has the most #expansive graph, and a function to output which airline offers the most direct (and thus #fastest) flights. Each Airport will be a class containing a linked list of airlines #present and name of city, where each airline will be a class containing their flight map. #Data will be fed into the program using a text file wherein each city exists and has its #available airlines contained underneath, which will be processed and read in to the #vertices of the airport graph, and from there the airline maps will be subsequently #constructed.
